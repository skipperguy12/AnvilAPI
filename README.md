AnvilAPI
========

AnvilAPI - A world management API, and lots of utilities. Comes with some nice commands for ease

Maven 2 for dependencies. You can fork this repo and send me a pull request as long as:
No methods are deprecated
Follows java coding conventions (mainly for classes, variables, not so much)
No statics are used when they are not required (Create objects of them in the main class, AnvilAPICore)

If you do happen to use this in a project, do not claim credit for it's utilities...
If it's based directly off of it, please give credit to it's original creator (me).
